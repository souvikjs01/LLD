# 📘 Low Level Design (LLD) & Design Patterns — Go Edition

A **practical, interview-oriented, and real-world focused** guide to mastering **Low Level Design (LLD)** and **Design Patterns** using **Golang**.

This repository is designed for:
- Backend engineers
- Go developers
- Interview preparation (Product & Startup companies)
- Writing clean, scalable, and maintainable systems

---

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository

- Understand **LLD fundamentals**
- Learn **design patterns with real Go examples**
- Apply **SOLID principles** in production-style code
- Think like a **system designer**, not just a coder
- Prepare for **machine coding & LLD interviews**

---

## 🧠 What is Low Level Design (LLD)?

Low Level Design focuses on:
- Structs and interfaces
- Object relationships
- Design patterns
- Code-level architecture
- Data flow and responsibilities

> LLD answers **“How do we implement this feature cleanly?”**

---

## 🧱 Core LLD Concepts

- Encapsulation
- Abstraction
- Composition over inheritance
- Interfaces & contracts
- Dependency Injection
- Separation of concerns

---

## 📐 SOLID Principles (with Go Examples)

- **S** — Single Responsibility Principle  
- **O** — Open / Closed Principle  
- **L** — Liskov Substitution Principle  
- **I** — Interface Segregation Principle  
- **D** — Dependency Inversion Principle
